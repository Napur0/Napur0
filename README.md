## Hello there! 👋

I'm a bachlor's student from Germany.


I like to learn, try out and build new and interesting things.

I am currently leaning into cyber security with focus on Web- and Networksecurity, looking for the subject that is fun and suits me best. :)


_If your looking for repos here, you're probably at the wrong place since they will be generally private. Public repos will be mostly to showcase certain features or focus on my current intrests and won't stay public permanently._
